# Healthcare-Premium-Prediction-using-ML
Healthcare Premium Prediction ML project that estimates annual insurance cost based on demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. Built using Scikit-learn with dual age-based models and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app with professional UI and real-time prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Insurance premium pricing depends on multiple factors such as age, medical history, smoking habits, BMI category, employment type, income, and genetic risk.
This project builds a predictive model to estimate the annual premium amount using supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing
- Categorical feature encoding
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Medical history risk transformation
- Separate scaling for different age groups

### 🔹 Model Strategy
Two separate models were trained:

- **Young Model** → Age < 25
- **Rest Model** → Age ≥ 25

This improves generalization and prediction accuracy by capturing age-specific risk behavior.

### 🔹 Artifacts Saved
- `model_young.joblib`
- `model_rest.joblib`
- `scaler_young.joblib`
- `scaler_rest.joblib`

Each scaler stores:
- The scaler object
- Columns used for scaling

## 🚀 Web Application (Streamlit)

The project includes a fully interactive web application where users can:

- Enter demographic details
- Select smoking status
- Choose insurance plan
- Provide medical history
- Get real-time premium prediction

### 🎨 UI Features
- Premium gradient background
- Highlighted premium output
- Automatic model selection based on age
- Fast loading using caching
